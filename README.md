# CA-Inventory-Dos
A ChannelAdvisor Inventory app to change Inventory Information Quickly in a warehouse with a Barcode gun so you don't have to be near a computer to do so.
Change Credentials in Code to match your account credentials. This won't work with my old credentials as my account is no longer active.
I put this app on a networked PC and used Telnet on MC9060 Barcode Scanning Guns to connect multiple guns to run the app so multiple users could use it at the same time.
